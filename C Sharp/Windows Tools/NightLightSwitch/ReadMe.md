# Night Light Switch

This is a little tool to toggle night light mode in Windows on/off using a 3rd party application.

The reason for a tool, is to automate the process in a batch, powershell, or scheduled task in case you have
a need for it to be toggled without user interaction.

## Usage

### NightLightSwitch.exe (options)

#### Options:
* on, 1, true   : Enable Night light mode
* off, 0, false : Disable Night light mode
