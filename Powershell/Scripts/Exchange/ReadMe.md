# Exchange Related Powershell Scripts

You will notice a lot of items will seem like duplicates. For example, removing room lists or removing rooms from
room lists is just using the normal distributiongroup commands. So why have scripts named for all the managing of
the room lists? Simplification for use by those who are unfamiliar with way it's done.
